# Open Tentacle
Open Tentacle is an open source robotics project for the design and implementation of a capable but affordable tentacle / continuum robot arm

# Goals
- Develop ROS compatable software integrations with easy to build structures and inexpensive electronic components

[ROS](https://www.ros.org/)

- Develop plug and play wrappers around the software systems

- Explore jointless continummn design solutions that do not require geared joints and offer less restrictive degrees of freedom

[Continuum Robots](https://www.google.com/search?q=Continuum++Robots&hs=Uh4&channel=fs&sxsrf=ALeKk03InHyTqxbpPBT8OlIoehBswv41-g:1590844447721&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjBy8ux1dvpAhVQBKYKHT8cD0MQ_AUoAXoECAwQAw&biw=1920&bih=832)

- Implement / Develop solutions that will allow using jointless continummn limbs for grasping/arm operations and use in locomotion such as walking and climbing

- Intragrate camera based control solutions that do not require specialized control hardware such as teach pendants or control gloves

[Perhaps along the line of hand/joint tracking such as in MediaPipe](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/08/on-device-real-time-hand-tracking-with.html)

- Explore tendon base haptic feedback wearables for better control feedback
